- the **HAM**murabi **PIX**elization supporting module

The hammurabi pixelization library is designed for hammurabi package, 
a galactic emission simulator.
Previously, hammurabi relies on the HEALPix library and built in Cartesian mesh,
where the simulation capability is limited by how HEALPix works.
We expect to be free from the HEALPix and simulate in a more general way by
knowing only the pointing directions in the sky.
